RESPONSIVE PORTFOLIO

The objective of this assignment was to create a responsive portfolio, to then later use to display our projects. The responsive aspect refers to the websites' ability to rearrange the design/layout depending on screen size. Most websites have separate blueprints for mobile and desktop that still follows the same theme. This can be delivered by Boostrap and CCS code.

ELEMENTS USED

•	Grids – from using grid reverencing, ie containers, rows and columns, in html I was able to layout the contents of the page and also turn containers into CSS boxes

•	Cards – I used cards for my portfolio page, because I found it the easiest for positioning the images. The same result could be made by using the grid techniques. It would just take a bit more time, though I think there would be a bit more styling range.

•	Navigation – For the navigation bar I used mostly bootstrap with some styling elements. For the collapse navbar I changed it flex row instead of toggle. This way I was able to get rid of the burger bar when in mobile screen and just have the options side my side, underneath the brand. I didn’t end up creating an about me page, separate to the heading(brand) just because it wasn’t the style design I was after

•	Fonts – For fonts I linked an URL from www.googlefonts.com to enable them

•	Icons – I also linked an URL from awesome fonts to enable using icons in the navbar

ISSUES FACED

•	Styling – I found it difficult to find a satisfying theme to run with. I’m hoping more practise in css and website creation in general will also improve aesthetics. Finding a good photo.

•	Nav bar – Changing navbar toggle to flex row. I ended up using development tools on other websites that use Bootstrap and finding flex-row in their code.

•	Nav bar icons – Changing the icons to the other side of the nav bar was quite difficult. I tried a lot of CSS techniques ie float right, items align right, but it didn’t work for me. So I ended up looking at other websites that used bootstrap to achieve what I was looking for and I ended up finding “ml-md-auto“ which fixed this problem

•	Background image – I used background-attachment, background-repeat, background-size and background-positioning CSS to style my background in for fitting, positioning and no repeat. I used the scroll for when I have more content.

IMPROVMENTS

At one point my aim was to change the icon section of the nav bar to the footer when in mobile screen. Which I did end up successfully doing but it wouldn’t style correctly. This is something I will reattempt to do later.
